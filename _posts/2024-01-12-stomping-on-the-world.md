**Stomping on the World** (estimated 2024) 

<div align="justify">

在很久很久以前与世界尽头之间，一只猫诞生了。时间又过了很久很久，我诞生了。我的生活乏善可陈，唯一的乐趣就是打电动。日常就在列车与铁轨的摩擦声中消磨殆尽。 <br /> 
 <br /> 
Within the realm of Tokusatsu-inspired cinematography, this short film aims to craft a metaphorical dance between an ordinary girl and the intricate tapestry of her emotions. As metaphors, monster materializes as a kaleidoscopic convergence of human sentiments—anger, boredom, sorrow, and love— as spectral mirrors, guiding the audience through the delicate interplay of vulnerability and resilience, offering a bizarre exploration of the girl's journey into self-discovery. <br /> 
 <br /> 
We wish to challenge everyone to delve into the monsters within, urging an introspective excavation that unearths the sublime beauty hidden beneath the surface of our own emotional terrain.
