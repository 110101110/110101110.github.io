**Pour Pierre** (2023) Paris, London

 <div align="justify"> 
  
The short documentary unfolds as a reflective tapestry, weaving together the tangible pulse of Paris and its people with the intangible threads of cultural memory. Pierre, the elusive puppeteer, becomes our Virgil in this journey, where every puppet is a repository of forgotten tales, and every body movement is a nod to the ephemeral dance between reality and the conjured. It's a visual essay urging the audience to linger in the interstices where the tangible and spectral converge. It is an invitation to traverse the labyrinth of art and culture with an insatiable child-like curiosity.
