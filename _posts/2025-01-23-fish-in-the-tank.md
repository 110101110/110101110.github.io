**Fish in the Tank** (wip) 

<div align="justify">

<p>
In this interactive pixel-art game, the player embodies a fish, free to navigate an open world, gather items, and engage with NPCs.   Through an ethnographic lens, this interactive essay examines the blurred boundaries between the social realities of human life and the simulated environment of a fish. It transforms play into a space of reflection, inviting the player to confront essential questions:

<p> <br> Am I human, or merely a fish in a tank? <p/>
